# TMCM-high-press-from-HTP 
This repository contains the Crystallographic Information (in VASP POSCAR format) of our recent high-pressure studies in TMCM-CdCl3 and TMCM-MnCl3 from experimentally reported high-temperature phase using dispersion (D3) corrected DFT calculation with PAW potentials and PBE XC-functional as implemented in PWSCF package. Preset study finds three sets of phases namely, monoclinic (M), orthorhombic (O), and monoclinic intermediate (M_int). The crystal structures associated with these phases as provided in this repository.
